## Black Thursday

Black Thursday develops a network of e-commerce data to enable meaningful 
business analytics. We extended the project to include the Google Charts
API and show our business analytics visually. 
Broadly speaking, this project applies concepts such as
class integration and referencing, test-driven development, and managing a 
huge project with distributed responsibilities.
